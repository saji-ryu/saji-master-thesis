  abstract  = {We present VAnnotatoR, a framework for generating so-called multimodal hypertexts. Based on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), VAnnotatoR enables the annotation and linkage of semiotic aggregates (texts, images and their segments) with walk-on-able animations of places and buildings. In this way, spatial locations can be linked, for example, to temporal locations and Discourse Referents (ranging over temporal locations, agents, objects, or instruments etc. of actions) or to texts and images describing or depicting them, respectively. VAnnotatoR represents segments of texts or images, discourse referents and animations as interactive, manipulable 3D objects which can be networked to generate multimodal hypertexts. The paper introduces the underlying model of hyperlinks and exemplifies VAnnotatoR by means of a project in the area of public history, the so-called Stolperwege project.},

activities between virtual interactions in the realm of the
computer and physical interactions with real objects within the
traditional office infrastructure. This paper extends previous work
that has attempted to bridge this gap, to connect physical objects
with virtual representations or computational functionality, via
various types of tags. We discuss a variety of scenarios we have
implemented using a novel combination of inexpensive, unobtrusive
and easy to use RFID tags, tag readers, portable computers and
wireless networking. This novel combination demonstrates the
utility of invisibly, seamlessly and portably linking physical
objects to networked electronic services and actions that are
naturally associated with their form.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a generic hypermedia model that is used as a framework for building context aware and mixed reality applications. It can handle different media elements, and it defines a presentation scheme that abstracts several relevant navigation concepts, including link awareness. The model specifies a base structure for the relation between spaces, either real or virtual, and supports contextual mechanisms. Additionally, it establishes a way to correlate real/virtual world objects with information present in the hypermedia graph. It also includes store/replay mechanisms that can be used to repurpose the content in new ways, including storytelling applications. The proposed model is being tested in a gaming and storytelling environment that integrates the real world, media elements and virtual 3D worlds. The paper presents the overall framework, the current implementation and evaluates its usage in the prototype application.},

  abstract  = {To be generally useful for collaborative research and learning, immersive virtual 3D spaces must include intuitive content creation and annotation tools. We describe some initial work to enhance one such environment (Croquet) for use in a broad range of collaborative applications. Annotations in virtual spaces may include features such as comments on objects in the environment, guided tours through the virtual space, and a history mechanism so that the evolution of objects or portions of the space can be replayed and examined. In general terms, an annotation is simply a relationship between one object and another and we examine several methods of displaying these relationships. To extend annotations across communities, the system architecture supports naming and packaging object and meta-information and integration of content into a shared digital repository. By distributing to users the power to create, edit, store, and retrieve objects and annotations, we promote development and re-use of meaningful content. Such systems can have great utility for the development of virtual environments for learning and research.},

Today, most application requirements are locating or real-time tracking of physical belongings inside buildings accurately; thus, the demand for indoor localization services has become a key prerequisite in some markets. Moreover, indoor localization technologies address the inadequacy of global positioning system inside a closed environment, like buildings. Based on this, though, this paper aims to provide the reader with a review of the recent advances in wireless indoor localization techniques and system to deliver a better understanding of state-of-the-art technologies and motivate new research efforts in this promising field. For this purpose, existing wireless localization position system and location estimation schemes are reviewed, as we also compare the related techniques and systems along with a conclusion and future trends.},
